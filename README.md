# Tensorflow and machine learning
This project contains my personal scripts and notebooks developed while learning to use Tensor Flow for machine learning tasks. 

Here are the first tutorials that I followerd:
- classification problems: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification
- regression problems: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/regression
- overfit and underfit: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/overfit_and_underfit

For each I wrote a notebook which is fundamentally the same as the ones on the online pages. They differ in wording, as I tried to reformulate things for me to understand better.

In the next weeks, I aim to start some personal small projects making use of Tensor Flow (and Keras) in order to familiarize myself with the "game".
