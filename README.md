# Tensorflow and machine learning
This project contains my personal scripts and notebooks developed while learning to use Tensor Flow for machine learning tasks. 

Here are the first tutorials that I followerd:
- classification problems: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification
- regression problems: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/regression
- overfit and underfit: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/overfit_and_underfit
- data augmentation: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/data_augmentation
- text classification: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/text_classification

For each I wrote a notebook which is fundamentally the same as the ones on the online pages. They differ in wording, as I tried to reformulate things for me to understand better. The overfit and underfit tutorial was very shitty and unclear. Too many functions that were only for output reasons or to improve readability of outputs, not enough about actual content. 

In the next weeks, I aim to start some personal small projects making use of Tensor Flow (and Keras) in order to familiarize myself with the "game".
